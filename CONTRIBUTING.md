## Note on Upcoming Licensing Clarifications
The licensing and contribution guidelines for SN Utils will be updated alongside the SN Utils Store App release.

These changes will clarify:
- how contributions relate to the broader Store App ecosystem  
- expectations for feature development and modifications  
- boundaries for redistribution or reuse of SN Utils code  

Further information will be published when the Store App becomes available.
